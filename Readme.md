# Threax.Provision.Azure
This project will create a vm and database in Azure that can run Threax .Net Core Apps. This demonstrates a framework for creating DevOps scripts using C# and .Net instead of the more traditional approach using bash or powershell. This enables the automation to use more advanced application development constructs like abstraction, dependency injection and automated testing.

This sample uses Az Powershell to create its infrastructure. The Az Cli stuff is in development.
